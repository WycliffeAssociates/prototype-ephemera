# ἀγγαρεύω/aggareuō
This word is an action. It is a verb.
* This word means to force someone to do a specific job
    * Sometimes this word is used when rulers forced people to do certain things
    * Sometimes this word is used when anyone forced someone to do something that no one wanted to do.
    * Doing this did not make people slaves, because they only served in one way and for a short time.
