# περιλείπομαι/perileipomai
This word describes a situation or how something is. It is a verb. However, it is not an action. 
* This word can mean to remain alive.
* This word can mean to remain in a place after everyone has gone away.

**Advice to translators**: This type of verb describes a state of being. 

See: 1 Thessalonians 4:15, 17
