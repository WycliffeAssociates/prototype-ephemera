# ἐγκρατεύομαι/egkrateuomai 
This word is an action. It is a verb.

* This word means to exercise or practice self-control. This is when a person controls or masters their desires and passions. They do not do the things they do not want to do, and they do the things they want to do. 

See: 1 Corinthians 7:9; 9:25
