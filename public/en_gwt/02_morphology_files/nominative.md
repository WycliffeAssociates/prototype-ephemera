# Nominative 
Nominative is a case.  Case is the form of a word that helps someone to know the function of the word in a sentence. 
Case helps the reader to know what the word is doing in a sentence. 

The nominative case can identify the subject of a sentence. 

## What types of words use case?
* **Noun** - Case on a noun helps the reader to know how someone or something relates to the action of the verb. 
* **Article** - Case on an article helps the reader know which word the article is attached to. 
* **Adjective** - Case on an adjective can help the reader to know which noun the adjective is describing. If the adjective is not used to describe something and it acts like a noun, case helps the reader to know how the word relates to the action of the verb. 
* **Participle** - Case on a participle is used in the same way as it is with the noun or adjective.
