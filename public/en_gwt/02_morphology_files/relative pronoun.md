# Relative Pronoun
Relative pronouns introduce adjective clauses and noun clauses. Both of these kinds of clauses are statements within a sentence. Adjective clauses are like adjectives because they describe a person or thing. Noun clauses are like nouns because they refer to a person, thing, or idea. In Greek, every adjective clause and every noun clause has a relative pronoun.

When the relative pronoun introduces an adjective clause, that pronoun is often translated as **_who_**, **_whom_**, **_that,_** **_which_**, or **_whose_**.

When the relative pronoun introduces a noun clause, that pronoun is often translated as **_whoever_**, **_whomever_**, or **_whatever_**.
