# Dative 

Dative is a case. Case is the form of a word that helps someone to know the function of the word in a sentence. 
Case helps the reader to know what the word is doing in a sentence. 

The dative case can identify the person or thing in the sentence that is indirectly affected by the action of the verb. Something is done or given to this person or thing. 

Sometimes the dative is translated by adding the word: **_to_**, **_for_**, **_with_**, **_by_**, **_by means of_**, **_in_**, **_at_**, **_upon_**, or **_besides_**. 

## What types of words use case?

* **Noun** - Case on a noun helps the reader to know how someone or something relates to the action of the verb. 
* **Article** - Case on an article helps the reader know which word the article is attached to. 
* **Adjective** - Case on an adjective can help the reader to know which noun the adjective is describing. If the adjective is not used to describe something and it acts like a noun, case helps the reader to know how the word relates to the action of the verb.
* **Participle** - Case on a participle is used in the same way as it is with the noun or adjective.
