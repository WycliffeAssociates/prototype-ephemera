# Genitive 
Genitive is a case. Case is the form of a word that helps someone to know the function of the word in a sentence. 
Case helps the reader to know what the word is doing in a sentence. 

The genitive case can identify to whom or to what something belongs. 

Sometimes the genitive is translated by adding the word **_of_** or **_from_**.

## What types of words use case?

* **Article** - Case on an article helps the reader know which word the article is attached to.
