## What types of words use case? 

* **Noun**- Case on a noun helps the reader to know how someone or something relates to the action of the verb. 
* **Article**- Case on an article helps the reader know which word the article is attached to. 
* **Adjective**- Case on an adjective can help the reader to know which noun the adjective is describing. If the adjective is not used to describe something and it acts like a noun, case helps the reader to know how the word relates to the action of the verb.
