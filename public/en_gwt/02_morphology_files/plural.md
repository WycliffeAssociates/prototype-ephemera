# Plural

Plural is one of the values of the grammatical category called number. Number is the form of a noun or a pronoun that shows whether it refers to one person, place, thing, or idea or to more than one person, place, thing, or idea. Greek has two values for number. They are singular and plural. The plural form is often used when talking about more than one person, place, thing, or idea. 

When certain other types of words in a sentence are associated a noun or pronoun, they also have the same number that the noun or pronoun has.
