# Accusative

Accusative is a case. Case is the form of a word that helps someone to know the function of the word in a sentence. 
Case helps the reader to know what the word is doing in a sentence. 

The accusative case is often used to identify the person or thing receiving the action. 

Sometimes the accusative is translated into English by adding the words **_to_**, **_for_**, **_with_**, **_by_**, **_by means of_**, **_in_**, **_at_**, **_upon_**, or **_besides_**. 

## What types of words use case?

* **Noun** - Case on a noun helps the reader to know how someone or something relates to the action of the verb. 
* **Article** - Case on an article helps the reader know which word the article is attached to. 
* **Adjective** - Case on an adjective can help the reader to know which noun the adjective is describing. If the adjective is not used to describe something and it acts like a noun, case helps the reader to know how the word relates to the action of the verb.
