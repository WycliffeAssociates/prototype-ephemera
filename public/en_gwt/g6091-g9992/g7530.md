# ἔυγε/euge
This word may tell something about the speaker's attitude toward what he is talking about. Or it may tell something about how one group of words in the sentence is related to another group of words. It is a particle.

* This word means well done.
    * This is what someone says to another person who did something well and deserves to receive honoring words.

See: Luke 19:17
