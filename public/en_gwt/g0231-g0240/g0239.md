# Ἁλληλούϊα/hallēluia

This is a word that a person uses to express a sudden or strong feeling. It is an interjection. 

* People said this when they wanted to honor God. This word means that God deserves for people to honor him and praise him. 

**Advice to translators**: An interjection can be a word that is not used with other words.
