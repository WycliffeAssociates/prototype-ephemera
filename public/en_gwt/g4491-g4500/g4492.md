# ῥιζόω/rhizoō
This word is an action. It is a verb.

* This word can mean to cause to take root. This is when something is planted and it begins to draw through its roots what it needs from the soil so it can grow.
* This word can mean to do something that is in some way like causing something to take root.

See: Ephesians 3:17; Colossians 2:7
