# ἐλαφρία/elaphria
The word is an idea. It is a noun.

* This word means lightness. This means the act of thinking about something lightly. A person who thinks lightly about a matter is likely to change their mind about it, because they do not take it seriously. They do not think the matter is important enough to make a firm decision about it.

See 2 Corinthians 1:17
