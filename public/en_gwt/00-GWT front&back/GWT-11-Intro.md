# Purpose of the GWT lexicon
This lexicon is intended to serve the needs of Mother-tongue translators and translation checkers and reviewers. It does this by providing the lexical meaning and other information about each word in the original language of the New Testament. 

This lexicon is written in WIT (Writing for International Translators) style so that non-professional translators can more easily translate it into any of the world's languages.

## How is the GWT organized?

The GWT is organized by Strong's numbers. Because there are different numbering systems, the GWT follows the Strong's numbering system that the Open Greek New Testament uses (see: [https://content.bibletranslationtools.org/WycliffeAssociates/OpenGNT](http://)).
