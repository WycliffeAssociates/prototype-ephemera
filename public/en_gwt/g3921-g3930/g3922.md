# παρεισέρχομαι/pareiserchomai
This word is an action. It is a verb.
* This word can mean to enter a group pretending to be part of it but really intending to harm it.
* This word can mean to come in closely beside something. This word is used to talk about something becoming a part of a situation in such a way as to change the situation.

See: Galatians 2:4; Romans 5:20
