# ἑτεροζυγέω/heterozugeō
This word describes a situation or how something is. It is a verb. However, it is not an action.

* This word can describe two animals who are unequally yoked. This is when two animals have a wooden yoke on them to drag a piece of equipment. When they are unequally yoked, these animals do not do the same amount of work.
* This word can describe people who are in some way like animals that are unequally yoked.

See: 2 Corinthians 6:14
