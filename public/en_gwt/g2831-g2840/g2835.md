# κοδράντης/kodrantēs
This word is a thing. It is a noun.

* This word means one fourth part of the smallest Roman coin. There were 64 of these coins in a denarius. A denarius was about how much money a person would have earned for a day of work. Therefore, this was a small coin without much value.
    * Bible translations often use the word for the least valuable coin in their culture to translate this word. For example, words like penny, cent, and farthing are used to translate this word.

See: Matthew 5:26; Mark 12:42
