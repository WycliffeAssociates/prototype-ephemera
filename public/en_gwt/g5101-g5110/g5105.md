# τοιγαροῦν/toigaroun
This word may tell something about the speaker's attitude toward what he is talking about. Or it may tell something about how one group of words in the sentence is related to another group of words. It is a particle.

* This word means therefore or so then.
    * When this word is used, a person should listen carefully to what the author said. What the author just said is true. It helps the person to understand the things that the author wrote next.

See: 1 Thessalonians 4:8; Hebrews 12:1
