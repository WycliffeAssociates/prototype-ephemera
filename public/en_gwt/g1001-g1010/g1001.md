* This word means to determine how deep an area of the sea.
    * A person determined the depth of the sea by taking a piece of metal attached to a rope and throwing it into the sea. The other end of the rope was attached to the boat or held by the person. The depth could be determined by measuring the rope as the piece of metal sank to the floor of the sea.
