# ἀκυρόω/akuroō
This word is a type of action. It is a verb.
* This word means to take away the power of something
    * When people take away the power of a command, they say or act like people do not have to obey that command. They may think that the person who spoke the command had no right to speak it. Or they may think that the person who spoke the command does not want people to keep that command now. 

See: Matthew 15:6; Mark 7:13; Galatians 3:17
