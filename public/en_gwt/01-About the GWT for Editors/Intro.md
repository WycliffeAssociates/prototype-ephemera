## Miscellaneous 

### How do we deal with connotations?
Some suggestions for dealing with connotative meaning. When this word is used, it is always used to talk about something that is bad (negative connotations; e.g. prideful). When this word is used, it is always used to talk about something that is good (positive connotation; e.g. joy). When this word is used, it can be used to insult someone (insult; e.g. fool) 

### How to communicate emphasis?

When this word is used, someone should listen carefully to what the author said (e.g. amen).
Amen- this word is used to emphasize something that happened….When this word is used, someone should listen carefully to what the author said. 

### References
If a word is used three times or less, include a reference to every instance of the word in the NT. This will be at the very bottom of the entry (See: 1 John 2:2; 4:10).

### Can we link to another lexical entry?

In a given lexical entry, you are able to link a different lexical entry. This is only done with Multi-word Expressions and superlatives. However, one should not do this for other purposes. If you create a link to a Multi-word Expression copy the expression you have drafted and paste it into the other entry as well. If you create a link for a superlative also create a link you do not need to create a link in the regular word back to the superlative (For examples see g0196 and g0199).

### How are Lexical Units ordered/prioritized?

For this lexicon we use flat, not tiered senses. Therefore, the Lexical Units are not given in a numbered list. We are treating each Lexical Unit as equal. Sub-senses are not used. As seen above, sub-bullets are only used for clarification. They are not divided into a lexical unit into different but corresponding sub-senses. The sequence should go Most frequent sense→ Less frequent sense→ Metaphorical usages→ Multi-Word Expressions. 

### What type of transliteration should be used?
Alpha (a), beta (b), gamma (g), delta (d), epsilon (e), zeta (z), eta (ē), thetha (th), iota (i), kappa (k), lambda (l), mu (m), nu (n), xi (x), omicron (o), pi (p), rho (r), sigma (s), tau (t), upsilon (u), phi (ph), chi (ch), psi (ps), omega (ō) , rough breathing mark (h), rho with rough breathing mark (rh)

No other acenting and no apostrophes will be used
Double gamma is tagged as (gg), not (ng)

### What type of information should I include?

Choose lexical information and the wording according to your reader’s language and dictionary skills.

### How should I introduce a sense?

Introduce a sense by a gloss if possible in a sentence. This word means X.

### What about a word that has a figurative sense?

We are avoiding two things in this: (1) Identifying a sense a specifically figurative by using a technical term, like figurative or metaphorical. (2) Interpreting the point of comparison with the literal sense. See “Metaphorical Usage” above for examples.


### How do we handle words with tagging issues?

We came across an issue concerning a word and how it was tagged. The word δέος (deos) does not have its own strong’s number. To complicate things, sometimes it is tagged as G0127, and other times it is tagged as G1169. We will follow the tagging used in the OGNT.


## Guidelines/Prohibitions/Limitations
We do not want to discuss a word’s use in different contexts (e.g. Kingdom of God/heaven). We only do this if it changes the meaning of the headword. 

We will not be using example sentences or giving cross-references for a given sense. This is problematic and inherently subjective. 

This is a lexicon, not a commentary. Keep away from doctrinal differences quagmire as much as possible (cf. Israel). 

We will not be discussing etymology.

We will not be helping with pronunciation beyond the simple transliteration.

We will not include parsing helps (e.g. article, gender, genitive ending).

Following WIT principles we will not be using technical terms and abbreviations. The names of the parts of speech are a notable exception to this because their meaning is also described for the reader.

Don’t rely on changes in typeface to indicate some type of shift. Headers are an exception to this rule. Do not use quotation marks. 

Instead of using  “clause” or “phrase,” try using “these words.”

We cannot slavishly follow the sense differentiation of BDAG as this would run into their copyright. Sense divisions are really unique to each dictionary/lexicon. While we can use the same number of senses BDAG use, we cannot use the same number every time.


Sometimes the ULB uses a particular wording. For example, it uses “holy ones” instead of “saints.” In these instances, have the lexicon follow the ULB. Define hagios as “holy ones” rather than “saints” (e.g. This word means holy ones). 
Helpful Tips

It can be helpful when constructing an entry to key the reader into what field it is in and then identify what differentiates it from other things in its field. This is called the genus-and-differentia model; e.g. a surgeon is a doctor who operates on people in a hospital, it identifies the surgeon as being in the field of types of doctors, then it clarifies what makes this doctor different from other doctors. This is better than saying, a surgeon is someone who cuts people open to make them better.
