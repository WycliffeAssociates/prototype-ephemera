# ἐδαφίζω/edaphizō
This word is an action. It is a verb.

* This word can mean to make level. This word can be used to talk about making ground flat
* This word can mean to throw to the ground. This word can be used to talk about destroying a city, tearing down all of its buildings, and killing the people who live there.

See: Luke 19:44
