# Ἀββᾶ/Abba  

The word is a type of person. It is a noun.


* This word means father.
    * In the Greek New Testament, it is only used when someone is speaking about God the Father.
    * In ancient times, this word was used when someone loved their father very much and trusted him
    * Sometimes, this word is not translated. Instead, it is written as “abba” because it is near another word translated as father (see: G3962)

See: Mark 14:36; Romans 8:15; Galatians 4:6
