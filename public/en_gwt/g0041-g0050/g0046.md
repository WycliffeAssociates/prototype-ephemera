# ἄγναφος/agnaphos

This word describes something. It is an adjective. 

* This word describes cloth that has never shrunk. Some kinds of cloth shrink when they get wet. That is, they get smaller. People make clothing with the cloth only after it has shrunk. This is because they do not want the clothing to shrink when they wash it.


See: Matthew 9:16; Mark 2:21
