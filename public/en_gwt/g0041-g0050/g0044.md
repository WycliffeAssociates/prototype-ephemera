# ἄγκιστρον/agkistron

This word is a type of thing. It is a noun. 

* This word means fishhook. A fishhook is a type of tool that people make for catching fish. It is a thin piece of metal that a person bends and throws into the water. Sometimes a fish bites the fishhook, and it sticks into the fish’s mouth. Then the fish cannot free itself from the hook.

See: Matthew 17:27
