# ἀκρασία/akrasia

This word is an idea. It is a noun. 

* This word means lack of self-control. A person who lacks self-control cannot stop themselves from doing things, even if these things are wrong or evil. They cannot stop themselves from doing the sinful things they want to do. 


See: Matthew 23:25; 1 Corinthians 7:5
